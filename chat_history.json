Since Supabase is available, consider using it for data storage if the user enables it. Otherwise, explore local storage options.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-09-29T08:51:23.712465"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a mobile car wash app for clients to request and track driver locations.

I've created a comprehensive mobile car wash app with the following features:\n\n## \ud83d\ude97 CarWash Pro - Mobile Car Wash App\n\n### **Key Features Implemented:**\n\n1. **Home Screen** (`app/(index)/index.tsx`)\n   - Clean, modern interface with service cards\n   - Quick stats showing total washes and savings\n   - Easy navigation to all main features\n\n2. **Request Car Wash** (`app/request-car-wash.tsx`)\n   - Service selection (Basic, Premium, Deluxe)\n   - Location input with \"Use Current Location\" option\n   - Contact information and preferred time slots\n   - Additional notes for special requests\n   - Complete booking flow with confirmation\n\n3. **Track Driver** (`app/track-driver.tsx`)\n   - Real-time driver information and status updates\n   - Mock map interface (since react-native-maps isn't supported in Natively)\n   - Driver contact details with call/message buttons\n   - Service progress tracking with visual indicators\n   - Animated status updates and completion celebration\n\n4. **Order History** (`app/order-history.tsx`)\n   - Complete order history with status tracking\n   - Summary statistics (completed orders, total spent)\n   - Rating system for completed services\n   - Reorder and receipt viewing options\n   - Empty state for new users\n\n### **Design Highlights:**\n\n- **Clean UI**: Minimalistic design with plenty of white space\n- **Smooth Animations**: Pulse animations for active tracking\n- **Consistent Theming**: Professional blue color scheme\n- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear back buttons and navigation flow\n- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges and progress tracking\n- **Interactive Elements**: Pressable cards with proper feedback\n\n### **Technical Features:**\n\n- **File-based Routing**: Using Expo Router for navigation\n- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout the app\n- **Responsive Design**: Works on both iOS and Android\n- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for demonstration\n- **Status Management**: Dynamic status updates with timers\n- **Form Validation**: Proper input validation and error handling\n\n### **Map Limitation Notice:**\n\nSince react-native-maps is not supported in Natively, I've created a placeholder that clearly informs users about this limitation. In a production environment, this would be replaced with a fully functional map showing real-time driver locations.\n\nThe app is ready to use and provides a complete car wash booking and tracking experience! Users can book services, track their drivers, and view their order history all within a beautifully designed interface."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-09-29T08:51:15Z"}]
